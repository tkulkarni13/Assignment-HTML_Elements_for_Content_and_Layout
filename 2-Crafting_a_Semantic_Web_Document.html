                    <p>Evaporation occurs when the physical state of water is changed from a liquid state to a gaseous state.
                        A considerable amount of heat, about 600 calories of energy for each gram of water, is exchanged during the change of state.
                        Typically, solar radiation and other factors such as air temperature, vapor pressure, wind, and atmospheric pressure affect the amount of natural evaporation that takes place in any geographic area.
                        Evaporation can occur on raindrops, and on free water surfaces such as seas and lakes.
                        It can even occur from water settled on vegetation, soil, rocks and snow. There is also evaporation caused by human activities.
                        Heated buildings experience evaporation of water settled on its surfaces. Evaporated moisture is lifted into the atmosphere from the ocean, land surfaces, and waterbodies as water vapor.
                        Some vapor always exists in the atmosphere.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Condensation is the process by which water vapor changes it's physical state from a vapor, most commonly, to a liquid.
                        Water vapor condenses onto small airborne particles to form dew, fog, or clouds. The most active particles that form clouds are sea salts, atmospheric ions caused by lightning,and combustion products containing sulfurous and nitrous acids.
                        Condensation is brought about by cooling of the air or by increasing the amount of vapor in the air to its saturation point.
                        When water vapor condenses back into a liquid state, the same large amount of heat ( 600 calories of energy per gram) that was needed to make it a vapor is released to the environment.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Precipitation is the process that occurs when any and all forms of water particles fall from the atmosphere and reach the ground.
                        There are two sub- processes that cause clouds to release precipitation, the coalescence process and the ice- crystal process.
                        As water drops reach a critical size, the drop is exposed to gravity and frictional drag.
                        A falling drop leaves a turbulent wake behind which allows smaller drops to fall faster and to be overtaken to join and combine with the lead drop.
                        The other sub-process that can occur is the ice-crystal formation process.
                        It ocurrs when ice develops in cold clouds or in cloud formations high in the atmosphere where freezing temperatures occur.
                        When nearby water droplets approach the crystals some droplets evaporate and condense on the crystals.
                        The crystals grow to a critical size and drop as snow or ice pellets.
                        Sometimes, as the pellets fall through lower elevation air, they melt and change into raindrops.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Runoff is flow from a drainage basin or watershed that appears in surface streams.
                        It generally consists of the flow that is unaffected by artificial diversions, storages or other works that society might have on or in a stream channel.
                        The flow is made up partly of precipitation that falls directly on the stream , surface runoff that flows over the land surface and through channels, subsurface runoff that infiltrates the surface soils and moves laterally towards the stream, and groundwater runoff from deep percolation through the soil horizons.
                        Part of the subsurface flow enters the stream quickly, while the remaining portion may take a longer period before joining the water in the stream.
                        When each of the component flows enter the stream, they form the total runoff.
                        The total runoff in the stream channels is called streamflow and it is generally regarded as direct runoff or base flow.</p>
